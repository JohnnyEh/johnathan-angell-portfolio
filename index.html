        <p class="description">I used to stare up into the sky and wonder if there was anything better.  It took far too long for me to realize that better wasn’t a place or a set of circumstances, it was a state of mind.  If I wanted things around me to be better I had to be better, and I had to think and do better.  And eventually, there won’t be anything better.  There will only be "best".<br> I am at the very beginning of that journey, and I would love for you to come along with me.  I am just starting out as a web designer, and across the page you’ll see some of what I’ve been working on. Soon, there will be much more.  Take a minute to look around send a message if you feel so inclined.</p>
